A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. while an expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. The evaluation of an expression produces a value, which is why expressions can appear on the right hand side of assignment statements. A value all by itself is a simple expression, and so is a variable. Evaluating a variable gives the value that the variable refers to."
